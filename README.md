This is part of a larger project. The scripts within are intended to integrate a discord bot with a MERN stack aplication.

Currently the main features of the bot are unfinished but users of the bot should be able to register themselves within the mongo database, update their username within said database and check the status of their account in that database; all with simple bot commands to be used within the discord.

The bots final features will include a system that modifies users "points" based on the reactions of other users to their posts in discord.
